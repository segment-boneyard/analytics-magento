# Analytics for Magento

> **NOTE**: Official support from Segment for this plugin is **deprecated**. We are currently looking for community maintainers. The current version of this plugin should be free of bugs but any existing and future development will be paused for the time being. We recommend exploring and using third party alternatives. **Specifically, the folks at Windsor Circle are maintaining an [active fork of the plugin](https://github.com/windsor-circle/analytics-magento) driving towards support for Magento 2.** If you have any questions, please send us an email at friends@segment.com!

**Analytics for Magento** is a Magento extension for [Segment](https://segment.com) that lets you send data to any analytics tool you want without writing any code yourself!

## Installing

To get up and running, check out our documentation at [DEPRECATED] [https://segment.com/docs/plugins/magento](https://segment.com/docs/plugins/magento). Installation takes less than five minutes!


## Support

If you run into issues, be sure to check out the [documentation](https://segment.com/docs/plugins/magento), and you can always reach out to our [support team](https://segment.com/support) for help!


## Developing

_Note: this section only applies if you are interested in contributing improvements to our Magento extension's source code. You don't need to read this to use the extension in your own store._

TODO: We don't yet have detailed instructions for installing a local development version of Magento.


## Deploying

_Note: this section only applies to Segment teammates, and details how we deploy new versions of the extension to the Magento Connect marketplace for end users of the extension to download._

Before deploying, make sure to pull in the latest changes from the remote repository:

    $ git pull origin master

The first step after making your changes to the extension source is to tag a new release of the extension. To do that, first bump the version number in [`app/etc/modules/Segment_Analytics.xml`](app/code/community/Segment/Analytics/etc/config.xml).

Then, update [`History.md`](History.md) with a summary of your changes.

Once you've bumped the version and updated the changelog, you need to rebuild the distribution files in [`dist/`](dist/) by running the build script:

    $ bin/build

Then commit those changes, and tag the release (where `X.X.X` is the number of the newest version):

    $ git commit -am 'X.X.X'
    $ git tag 'X.X.X'
    $ git push origin master
    $ git push origin X.X.X

Once you've done that, you'll need to log into our [Magento Connect]() account, and navigate to **Your Account > Developers > Manage Extensions** and click the **Edit** button on the **Analytics for Magento** extension. That will take you to the extension editing page. From there, click the **Versions** tab and then the **Add new version** button.

Fill out the form for adding a new version, supplying the `X.X.X` version number as the **Release Notes Title** as well, and the list from [`History.md`](History.md) as the **Release Notes**. For the **Versions** check `1.7` and above. Then click the **Continue to upload** button.

On the upload form page click **Choose File** and find the `analytics-magento-X.X.X` file on your computer from the [`dist/`](dist) directory, then hit **Upload and save**. 

And you're finally done!
